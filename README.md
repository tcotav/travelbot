## Travelbot

Travelbot is simple demo program that, given an overall map of stops as x,y coordinates, we generate a map of 3-5 stops, and then our bot travels along the path to the end.  At the end, it turns around and follows the path back.  Eventually, we'll add error cases and other things to the app (in support of doing more stuff to the travelbots with our operators).

Used as the app controlled by the operator [travelbot-operator](https://github.com/tcotav/travelbot-operator).

Use this to play with operators.
